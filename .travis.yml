script:
  # compile all files - ensure that syntax is correct
  - python -m compileall common common/test common/plugins qt4 qt4/plugins qt4/test
  # run backend unit tests - ensure that functionality is correct
  #- cd common && ./configure && make unittest-v
  # run UI unit tests - can't work without pyqt installed properly in the virtualend
  # you can't install pyqt through pip. i tried installing globally with apt-get install python3-pyqt4 and then copying from site-packages into the virtualenv without success
  # also tried compiling pyqt4 locally but that had problems on make install
  #- cd ../qt4 && ./configure && make unittest-v
