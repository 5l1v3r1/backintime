TODO:
* use rsync return code to check that the snapshot was really taken (no out of space, copy error ...)
* uid/gid translate table with 'Full rsync mode'
* hide failure msg for restore perms if perms are identical
* make crontab >/dev/null optional
* link plugins so they can be found in source, too
* alternative install locations doesn't work
