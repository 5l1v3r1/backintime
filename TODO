TODO:
* use rsync return code to check that the snapshot was really taken (no out of space, copy error ...)
* uid/gid translate table with 'Full rsync mode'
* hide failure msg for restore perms if perms are identical
TODO/Kodanda:
* create a background thread to fully populate the directory tree recursively. 
  (might need to subclass QFileSystemModel and use canFetchMore and override fetchMore)
* add a status indicator and warning for incomplete search results while the filemodel
  keeps loading.
* dolphin integration service menus with restore functionality
